			//A statement is a line of code in C#.
			//Multiple statements make up blocks of code.
			//Each one of the below lines is a statement:

			double width = 5.5;
			double length = 11;
			double area1 = width * length;

			//Statements can be broken down into expressions
			//which are a combination of operators & operands
			//This is an expression: 

			double area2 = width * length;

			//Operands are the 'subject' of the statement like variables, methods, and classes.

			double area3 = width * length; // the operands are area, width, and length.

			//Operators are the verbs that act on the operand. 

			double area4 = width * length; // the operators are = and *.
