			//A statement is a line of code in C#.
			//Multiple statements make up blocks of code.
			//Each one of the below lines is a statement:

			double width = 5.5;
			double length = 11;
			double area1 = width * length;

			//Expressions are a block of code like an if statement
			//or a switch statement:
			if (area1 > 50){
				Console.WriteLine("Your area is big.");
				Console.Write("Wooh!");
			}

			//Operands are the 'subject' of the statement like variables, methods, and classes.

			double area3 = width * length; // the operands are area, width, and length.

			//Operators are the verbs that act on the operand. 

			double area4 = width * length; // the operators are = and *.
